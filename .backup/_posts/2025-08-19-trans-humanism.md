Progress extends our capacities; wisdom sets their aim. Trans‑humanism tempts us with speed, strength, and longevity, but the central questions remain human: what is worth wanting, and at what cost to persons, communities, and the living world? Any serious vision must balance augmentation with humility, equity, and ecological realism.

Three anchors I find helpful:

- Dignity first: treat persons as ends, not means.
- Stewardship: measure gains against planetary and social constraints.
- Pluralism: allow many paths to flourish — no single blueprint for the “enhanced” life.

Tools are neutral only in slogans. Our designs design us back; let’s choose well.
