Science advances through constraints — but not only through them. Methods give us discipline; phenomena demand flexibility. Following Feyerabend’s spirit, I like “anything goes” as a warning against dogma, not a license for sloppiness.

Three working heuristics:

- Model modestly: every model omits; state what and why.
- Tradeoffs explicit: precision, realism, and generality rarely peak together.
- Converge from many angles: proofs, numerics, experiments, and history inform one another.

When in doubt, let reality overrule elegance. Neat theories are means, not ends.
