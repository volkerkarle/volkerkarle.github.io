We study a **two-component Bose gas** in two dimensions at low temperatures with short-range repulsive interactions.  
When both components are superfluid, they are coupled through the **Andreev–Bashkin effect**, which induces a nondissipative drag between the two flows:

$$j_1 = \tilde{n}_1 v_1 + n_{\mathrm{dr}} v_2, \quad
j_2 = \tilde{n}_2 v_2 + n_{\mathrm{dr}} v_1 .$$

Here, $${\tilde{n}}_i$$ are the renormalized superfluid densities and $$n_{\mathrm{dr}}$$ is the drag density.  

At finite temperature, topological vortex excitations destroy superfluidity through a **Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) transition**.  We extend the BKT renormalization group flow to coupled mixtures and find that vortices in one species can induce the breakdown of superfluidity in the other. This leads to a **locking of critical temperatures**:

$$
T_c^{(1)} \approx T_c^{(2)} ,
$$

a striking departure from the uncoupled case where each component has its own transition. These results highlight how quantum fluctuations and vortex interactions create **coupled superfluid phases**, relevant for cold atoms, bilayer systems, multiband superconductors, and even neutron star matter.
